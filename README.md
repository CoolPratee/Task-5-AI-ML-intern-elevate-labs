Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

 Objective
The objective of this project is to understand and implement tree-based machine learning models such as Decision Trees and Random Forests for classification.

Dataset
Heart Disease Dataset (heart.csv)

Tasks Performed

1. Trained a Decision Tree Classifier
2. Visualized the Decision Tree
3. Controlled overfitting using max_depth
4. Trained a Random Forest model
5. Compared accuracy of models
6. Analyzed feature importance
7. Evaluated model using cross-validation

Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

Results

- Decision Tree Accuracy: ~80-85%
- Random Forest Accuracy: ~85-90%
- Random Forest performed better due to ensemble learning

Feature Importance

Important features include:
- cp (chest pain)
- thalach (max heart rate)
- oldpeak
- ca

Conclusion

Random Forest provides better accuracy and reduces overfitting compared to Decision Tree. Cross-validation ensures model reliability.
